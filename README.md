# Chainlink-Price-Test-Oracle


Successfully created and deployed an oracle smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

I saw how we can extend the capabilities of blockchains and smart contracts into real-world applications by providing accurate data to our decentralized applications.

Creating secure and trustworthy oracles is a key aspect of the blockchain revolution, as it enables the movement of off-chain world systems onto on-chain systems. In the EthPrice smart contract implementation, I looked at how Chainlink helps to ensure the reliability of data used in DApps by providing a list of vetted, single-source data providers and decentralized data providers.
